Deck Builder
 
About
Tabletop Simulator allows its players to provide custom card decks. These decks are JPG or PNG images which are split into a 10x7 grid. Manually assembling cards in this format can be a pain. The Deck Builder provides a quick and easy way to create decks and export them to an image file. You can even save a deck configuration and load it in when you want to make changes. All image placement and resizing is done for you.
 
Getting Started
To create a new deck, use the menu File➙New Deck (Ctrl+N).
To save a deck configuration, use the menu File➙Save Deck (Ctrl+S), or File➙Save Deck As (Ctrl+Shift+S) it save it as a new file. Note that this file is not used by Tabletop Simulator, and is only used by this application. See Export Deck below.
To open a previously saved deck configuration, use the menu File➙Open Deck (Ctrl+O) and select the .tsdb file. You can select multiple files to open them all at once.
To save your deck in a form that Tabletop Simulator can use, use the menu File➙Export Deck (Ctrl+E). This menu will prompt you to enter some export options. The width and height are the dimensions of the image to be saved (in general, you should be fine leaving them as they are). Next, you can choose whether to resize the image with high or low quality. Note that this quality setting is only for resizing of the image. High Quality will produce a smoother output image. However, some users may prefer the Low Quality option which will produce a blocky output image. Once you've selected the options, click on the Export button. You can save it as a JPG (lossy) or PNG (lossless) file.
Additionally, you can use the menu File➙Clone Deck (Ctrl+Shift+C) to clone your current deck and add it in the next tab.
